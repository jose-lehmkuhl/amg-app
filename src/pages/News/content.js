    content: "Formula 1 championship leader Lewis Hamilton believes his start to the season has been \"quite an average performance from myself\", despite winning four of the six races so far.\nHamilton's Monaco Grand Prix victory moved him 17 points clear of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas in the title battle.\n\nIt came after only his second pole position of the season, having admitted during the previous race weekend in Spain that he was struggling with one-lap performance so far.\nHamilton said: \"I definitely feel that it's been quite an average performance from myself. Maybe above average, but generally quite average for the first six races.\n\"I feel like I've got the best I could get [from the results]. I've arrived prepared, the best prepared I could be. But in terms of extracting the true performance from the car, I feel like I've struggled a little bit in these six races.\"\nHamilton's four victories and two second-place results put him on 137 points after six races.\n\nThat is 27 points more than at the same stage last season and 33 more than in 2017.\n\nIt also edges his previous best-ever start to a season, when he began the 2015 campaign with three wins, two second places and a third."

    content: "Valtteri Bottas says Formula 1 rival Max Verstappen \"kept drifting to the right\" during their pitlane incident in the Monaco Grand Prix, which he feared had been ruined.\nBottas was running second behind teammate Lewis Hamilton when the safety car was triggered early in the Monte Carlo race, and a slightly faster pitstop meant Red Bull released Verstappen into Bottas's path in the pitlane.\n\nThe two made contact and Bottas was forced to nudge the wall on his right-hand side, breaking his wheel and forcing him to make a second stop.\n\nHe was able to make that under the safety car and only dropped to fourth behind Sebastian Vettel, which became third at the finish thanks to Verstappen getting a five-second penalty for the incident.\n\n\"That was the thing that made the race really more difficult,\" said Bottas. \"We stopped the same time as Lewis, I made a gap between us before we stopped.\n\n\"For some reason our stop was a bit slow. Max got alongside me in the pitlane even though he was behind before. We were side-by-side, I kept my line and he kept drifting to the right.\n\n\"We touched and I also touched the wall because there was no more space. Honestly, I thought when I had had to stop again that I would go to the back of the grid but luckily I only lost one more place. Unlucky but lucky at the same time. It could have been a lot worse.\"\n\nVerstappen said Red Bull \"did everything right\" at the pitstop and claimed he was not aware Bottas was next to him.\n\n\"I didn't know there was anyone next to me because they released me,\" he said. \"I was just going, it was all getting a bit tight. We were ahead but it was a shame that we touched. I couldn't see him.\"\n\nThe stewards deemed Verstappen breached Article 28.13a of the sporting regulations, which states cars \"must not be released from a garage or pit stop position in way that could endanger pit lane personnel or another driver\".\n\nUnlike Article 28.13d, which explicitly refers to a car \"deemed to have been released in an unsafe condition\" and demands a 10-second stop-go penalty, the rule Verstappen was determined to have breached does not carry a specific penalty.\n\nTherefore, in accordance with recent precedent for the same offence, he was handed a five-second time penalty and two penalty points.\n\nAsked by Motorsport.com if he felt that punishment was sufficient, Bottas said: \"It's a tricky one because there is no way I could ever gain back the positions I lost, except at least Max's position with his penalty.\n\n\"But the position I lost to Sebastian there's no way I'd ever gain it back. He did his penalty, I think it's OK. There's not much to say more than that.",

    content: "Lewis Hamilton was adamant over the radio that he needed a \"miracle\" to win the Monaco Grand Prix given his tyre situation and Max Verstappen's hounding. Does this rate as one of his greatest victories?\nLewis Hamilton's Monaco Grand Prix record is patchy for a driver of his virtuosity. He's always been fast on the tortuously twisty streets, all the way back to Formula 3 days when he won here, but his under-pressure victory in the 2019 race was only the third of his 77 F1 wins to come in Monte Carlo.\n\nIf there was any doubt about how desperately Hamilton wants to build a legacy here that could stand with that of his hero Ayrton Senna, you only had to witness his joyous fence-climbing reaction to bagging what was somehow only his second pole position here in 13 attempts.",

    content: "Monaco Grand Prix winner Lewis Hamilton says he was going to \"crash or finish\" nursing his severely worn tyres in the race, which he described as \"the hardest I have had\".\nHamilton led the way from pole but was forced into an early stop by a safety car for debris left by Charles Leclerc's accident at La Rascasse.\n\nThe reigning champion was equipped with medium tyres during his sole pitstop, which committed him to a 67-lap stint on the C4 compound – while his rivals behind had taken on fresh sets of hard rubber.\n\nHamilton began to struggle with his tyres well before the end of the race, taking care of a very worn front-left tyre as he fought off Max Verstappen's attacks until the chequered flag.\n\nBut while he repeatedly expressed his discontent and worry over the strategy to his Mercedes team over the radio, and labelled the tyres as “dead” at one point, Hamilton confirmed after the race that he never entertained a second pitstop – having lost a Monaco win to then-teammate Nico Rosberg due to an extra pitstop in 2015.\n\n“I was never going to come in. A few years ago I was in the lead and then I’ve come in and learned the hard way as I lost the race,” Hamilton recalled.\n\n“I wasn’t going to come in. I was going to crash or finish. I was driving around on nothing, you can see how much understeer I had, the car wasn’t turning.\n\n“Ultimately it was the wrong tyre. Nonetheless this team has done an incredible job, what we have achieved in these first six races is remarkable.”\n\nHamilton said the drive for his 77th Formula 1 win was as difficult as any he could remember, while dedicating the victory to the late Mercedes non-executive chairman and F1 legend Niki Lauda.\n\n“Definitely for me the hardest race I think I have had - nonetheless I really was fighting with the spirit of Niki [within me].\n\n“Niki has been such an influential person in our team, helping us to get where we are, so I take my hat off today.\n\n“I was trying to stay focused and trying to make him proud. We truly miss him.”\n\nVerstappen attempted a late lunge down the inside of Hamilton at the chicane with two laps left to run, with the pair having what Hamilton described as “a light touch”.\n\nThe incident was investigated by the stewards, but neither driver was summoned and a verdict of 'no further action' was soon confirmed.\n\n“It was close, a bit of a late dive, luckily I saw him last-minute,\" Hamilton said of Verstappen.\n\n“But he wasn’t really... I think his front wing was alongside my rear wheel, so he wasn’t fully past.\"",

    content: "Lewis Hamilton says Mercedes' first Formula 1 engine upgrade of the season is among the improvements he expects to see for the next race in Canada.\nMercedes has dominated the start of the 2019 season, winning all six races and scoring two podium finishes at every grand prix.\n\nHamilton won the previous race in Monaco after surviving race-long pressure from Red Bull's Max Verstappen, though his task was made harder by Mercedes later admitting it had put him on the wrong tyres.\n\nThe five-time world champion said he and Mercedes still had room to improve ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix in two weekends' time.\n\n\"A lot of analysis will be made, particularly towards trying to understand the tyres better and deliver better in terms of our processes,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"And on my side, [I am] trying to work even better with my engineers to try and extract more from my car.\n\n\"That means Bono [Peter Bonnington, Hamilton's race engineer] and Marcus [Dudley, performance engineer] and a lot of the engineers trying to extract more information from the energy recovery system, and positioning the information in the right way so I can deliver more from this car.\n\n\"And I know the guys back at the factory are working on developments. We will probably have a new engine by the next race, so the car will continue to move forward as we will.\"\n\nMercedes intended to bring its upgraded engine to the Canadian Grand Prix last year but postponed that by one race to France after a quality issue.\n\nIt is the only engine manufacturer still to introduce its first upgrade of the season, and thus Mercedes is on a conventional schedule.\n\nHonda was the first to do so, bringing forward its 'Spec 2' engine for reliability reasons at round four in Azerbaijan.\n\nRenault had a new-spec engine on reliability grounds for the following race in Spain, where Ferrari introduced its own upgrade in the pursuit of greater performance.\n\nIf a driver uses more than three engines in a season they will begin to incur grid penalties, with Mercedes arguably now best-placed to avoid that scenario.\n\nDespite that, and its commanding position atop both drivers' and teams' championships, Hamilton insists Mercedes will not relent in its quest to improve.\n\nHe said his rivals were \"as close as they could be\" in Monaco but praised his team for a race performance that \"generally was very, very strong\".\n\nHamilton added: \"Obviously we were on the wrong tyres, so strategically we could have done a better job, without a doubt. We don't always get that perfect and I think we'll definitely learn from it. What doesn't break you only makes you stronger.\"",

The speed was mind-boggling [on Saturday] and I have no doubt about this, that it's going to annoy the hell out of him, and he's going to come back very, very strong in Montreal.\"\n\nWhile Bottas was clearly disappointed about needing to change tyres after suffering the puncture, he confessed afterwards that he feared stopping again would put him to the back of the field.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought that when I got the puncture and had to stop again, that I was going to be at the back of the grid but luckily only lost a couple of places,\" he explained.\n\n\"So, unlucky but lucky at the same time. It could have been a lot worse. Still important points, obviously disappointing going backwards from where you start from – but sometimes it goes like this.\"",

And then the race was awesome.\n\n\“The team messed it up a little bit for him, and then he drove it home in the way he had to. He managed it perfectly, so really spectacular.”\n\nWebber also commended the approach taken by Hamilton's Mercedes team on the pitwall.\n\n\"I think the boys were giving him good chat too just to justify the scenario. Clearly they picked the wrong tyre, they couldn’t say they were on the right tyre, that wasn’t the case.\n\n\"But the scenario was such that there was other information in the race to back up that it was possible.\"\n\nWebber was pleased to see Verstappen launch an attempt to pass Hamilton in the closing laps.\n\n\“Lewis could have been going two or three seconds slower at the end there, and it still would have been hard for Max to pass,\" Webber said.\n\n\"He had a go, but Lewis was strong in the tunnel, and Mercedes power was very useful at key points.\n\n\“But it was worthwhile, absolutely, he’s a racer. To sit there for over an hour and a half is absolutely horrendous for your head. To sleep at night and think I didn’t even try something – but he did try, and that’s the racer in him, and that’s what we all want to see.”",

    content: "Mercedes has revealed that a mistake at Lewis Hamilton’s pitstop in the Monaco Grand Prix delayed the subsequent stop of Valtteri Bottas, consequently leading to the Finn's pitlane collision with Max Verstappen.\nMercedes planned a double-stacked stop for Hamilton and Bottas when the safety car came out early in the Formula 1 race, and the Finn backed off to give himself a gap and delay Verstappen and Sebastian Vettel, who were behind him.\n\nHowever, Mercedes strategy director James Vowles has revealed that on leaving the pits Hamilton hit an airgun, and recovering from that triggered a slight delay in Bottas’s stop.\n\n\“If you can stop under a safety car in Monaco, it really is the best of all worlds,” said Vowles in a team video. \“From lap 11 we knew we could take the tyres to the end of the race - we believed the medium, but the hard would’ve easily made it as well and our competitors Vettel and Verstappen knew this too.\n\n\“That’s why they came in. When you come in for a double-stack safety car [stop], what’s really important is making a gap between your cars, so that the first car can be serviced in the pitlane and the second one can slot straight in. And Valtteri did that perfectly on track.\n\n\“Lewis had his pitstop, drove out, and you would’ve seen Valtteri came straight back in again. And now it’s a straight race between Vettel, Verstappen and Valtteri for a pitstop.\n\n\"Unfortunately as Lewis left, he clipped one of the guns and it took just a few seconds for them to reset properly and the cost to us was a couple of tenths. That’s it, but that’s all you need.”\n\nBottas lost the race out of the pits to Verstappen, who subsequently received a penalty for an unsafe release.\n\nMercedes has also showcased a picture of the right front wheel that Bottas damaged when he was edged into the pitwall barrier by the Red Bull driver, this leading to an instant loss of pressure that was detected on the out-lap.\n\nBottas was thus forced to come straight back in for new tyres on the next lap, losing only the one position to Vettel, as the field had not bunched up.\n\n\“We had a couple of tenths loss on Valtteri’s pit stop, Red Bull had a very, very good pit stop, one of the best of the year for them, and those extremes meant that as the cars went out and were in the pit lane, Verstappen came alongside, hit the left-hand side of Valtteri’s car, pushing the right-hand side into the wall and damaging that front-right wheel, which is what you can see in this picture.\n\n\“Now, this image is obviously post-race, live we can see tyre pressures and we had a quick look at them to see what was going on. And after a few corners, when Valtteri was back out on track, it became evident that we had a problem and we were starting to lose pressure.\n\n\“We had to react then and there to bring Valtteri straight back in. If we waited any longer, Valtteri would’ve been last. We brought Valtteri back in the pit lane, fitted the hard tyre, which was the best of the tyres [but] not known at the time, and then he re-joined back in P4.”",
